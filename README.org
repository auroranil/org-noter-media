* TODO Operations
** Inserting [0/1]
  - [ ] =org-noter-insert-note=
** Synchronising [0/1]
   - [ ] =org-noter-sync-current-note=
** Media player specific [0/1]
   - [ ] =org-noter-media-toggle-play=

* TODO Plan
  1. [ ] Creating new =org-noter= session with media file in =NOTER_DOCUMENT=
         property should open =mpv= playing that media file from beginning
  2. [ ] Specifying =NOTER_PAGE= property in root org heading should open
         =mpv= playing that media file at that specified time
  3. [ ] Communicate to =org-noter-media= its timestamp as video is playing,
         so that it knows when to sync automatically
  4. [ ] Specifying =NOTER_PAGE= property in non-root org heading should
         show that heading and hide others (when =org-noter-hide-others= is
         set to true) when playing video reaches that section
  5. [ ] Implement =org-noter-sync-current-note=
  6. [ ] Implement =org-noter-insert-note=
  7. [ ] Implement =org-noter-media-toggle-play=
  8. [ ] Find out a way to customise org-noter properties so that its
         terminology aligns with media files
